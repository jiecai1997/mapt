Kelly Zhang: Worked on the backend for this whole project. Worked on many of the sql and database finepoints. For milestone 1, I wrote assumptions and general information for the milestone, contributed the details idea and creation of the tables with trigger & relevent test samples, helped review the E/R diagram and check over test cases. For milestone 2, I set up the models for all the tables and worked on registration route along with adding trips and flights within our HTML backend dummy environment. I seeded the database with all the production sized dataset which Eric and Jie cleaned. I also worked on creating some test inserts. Set up scripts to help run everything and some templates. Since milestone 2, I have reformatted the models to conform to all the relevant relationships detailed by SQLAlchemy. This included a lot of reformatting and testing. I also settled on using SQLAlchemy as just an abstraction layer and passing SQL statements through the execute function to create a consistent template for our routes. I finished debugging and setting up the backend db models and seeding. Created the session tokens for user privacy and login verification and integrated them into the routes. Created the statistics route, worked on login with Jie and Airports with Eric. Implemented the various error checking for display in the frontend. Worked with Ethan and Jaiveer to debug errors and bring the frontend and backend together. I helped write the report by going over all the assumptions and adding detail to our stack.
